# InfraLens

AI-powered infrastructure health monitoring and risk prediction system.

## Problem
Infrastructure like bridges and buildings develop cracks and structural damage over time. Manual inspections are slow, expensive, and sometimes inaccurate.

## Solution
InfraLens uses computer vision and machine learning to:
- Detect cracks from images
- Generate structural health scores
- Predict failure risk
- Provide visual analytics dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning
- Streamlit

## Goal
To build a scalable and intelligent infrastructure monitoring system.
